## üß™ Testing Workflow

### 1. Setup Test Users
**Via Super Admin Panel:**
1. Login as `admin@ezpog.io`
2. Navigate to `/super-admin/users`
3. Click "Invite User" for each persona
4. Fill in details (name, email, org, role)
5. Copy invitation links
6. Open invitation links in incognito windows
7. Complete signup for each user

### 2. Multi-User Testing
**Use browser profiles to test simultaneously:**
- **Chrome Profile 1:** Super Admin (admin@ezpog.io)
- **Chrome Profile 2:** Org Admin (demoadmin@ezpog.io)
- **Incognito Window 1:** Manager (manager@ezpog.io)
- **Incognito Window 2:** Regular User (user@ezpog.io)
- **Incognito Window 3:** Field Team (fieldteam@ezpog.io)

### 3. Test Execution
1. Start with Super Admin tests
2. Create test data (orgs, projects, products)
3. Test each persona in order (admin ‚Üí manager ‚Üí user ‚Üí field team)
4. Verify permissions at each level
5. Test cross-org isolation
6. Test edge cases and error handling

### 4. Real-Time Testing
1. Have two users logged in simultaneously
2. User A creates a project
3. User B should see update in real-time
4. Test live updates across all features
