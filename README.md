- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite (replace Create React App)
- **UI Framework:** TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui (replace Chakra/MUI)
- **State Management:** Zustand + TanStack Query (replace Redux)
- **Backend:** Firebase (consolidated to one project)

### 🤔 Recommended (Pending Approval)
- **Canvas Library:** React Flow (over Konva)
  - Faster development
  - Modern patterns
  - Better UX
  - Can add Konva later if needed

## 🤝 How to Proceed

### Option A: Start Fresh (Recommended)
1. Create new project with modern stack
2. Migrate features from both codebases
3. Use existing code as reference
4. **Timeline:** 16 weeks to MVP

### Option B: Modernize ezpog-io
1. Update dependencies in place
2. Refactor to new architecture
3. Add advanced planogram features
4. **Timeline:** 12 weeks to MVP (riskier)

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
1. Keep ezpog-io running
2. Build new planogram module separately
3. Integrate when ready
4. **Timeline:** 20 weeks total (safer)

**Recommendation: Option A** - Clean slate, modern architecture, less technical debt
