# EZPOG.io Project Decisions

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** LOCKED - Implementation Phase

---

## üîí LOCKED DECISIONS

These decisions are final and should guide all development work:

### 1. Canvas Technology
**DECISION: React Flow (@xyflow/react)**

**Rationale:**
- 60% faster development
- Modern UX meets 2025 expectations
- Easier to find developers
- Built for complex scenarios
- Active development, modern patterns
- Better UX than Blue Yonder

**Status:** ‚úÖ APPROVED

---

### 2. Implementation Approach
**DECISION: Approach A - Start Fresh**

**What This Means:**
- Create new project with modern stack
- Migrate features from both codebases
- Use existing code as reference
- Clean slate, no technical debt

**Timeline:** 16 weeks to MVP

**Status:** ‚úÖ APPROVED

---

### 3. Technology Stack
**CONFIRMED:**
- React 18.3 + TypeScript
- Vite (build tool)
- React Router v6
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- Zustand (state management)
- TanStack Query v5 (server state)
- React Flow (planogram canvas)
- Framer Motion (animations)
- Firebase (backend)

**Status:** ‚úÖ LOCKED

## üìã Development Rules

### ALWAYS Follow These Rules:

1. **Refer to the Implementation Roadmap**
   - Location: `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`
   - Follow week-by-week plan
   - Complete phases in order
   - Don't skip ahead

2. **Stay on Task**
   - Focus on current phase
   - Don't add features not in roadmap
   - Avoid scope creep
   - Prioritize ruthlessly

3. **Check Current Phase**
   - Before starting work, confirm current phase
   - Review phase goals and tasks
   - Complete deliverables before moving on

4. **Document Progress**
   - Update task completion status
   - Note any blockers
   - Track time spent
   - Record decisions made

5. **No Feature Creep**
   - Stick to MVP features for first 16 weeks
   - Save "nice to have" for post-MVP
   - Focus on core functionality
   - Polish comes in Phase 6 (weeks 13-14)

## üö´ What NOT to Do

### Avoid These Pitfalls:

1. **Don't switch technologies mid-project**
   - We chose React Flow - stick with it
   - No "let's try this instead"

2. **Don't add features not in roadmap**
   - "Wouldn't it be cool if..." ‚Üí Post-MVP list
   - Focus on core functionality first

3. **Don't skip testing**
   - Test as you build
   - Don't accumulate technical debt

4. **Don't optimize prematurely**
   - Get it working first
   - Optimize in Phase 6 (weeks 13-14)

5. **Don't refactor during feature development**
   - Build features in current phase
   - Refactor in dedicated time

## ‚úÖ Development Checklist (Before Each Work Session)

Before starting work, ask:

- [ ] What phase am I in?
- [ ] What are the goals for this phase?
- [ ] What tasks are assigned to this week?
- [ ] Have I completed previous tasks?
- [ ] Am I following the technology stack?
- [ ] Is this feature in the MVP scope?
